# Grub password protect: 

At the server, generate a hash of your desired password: 

grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2
Create /etc/grub.d/01_passwd with below content:

```
#!/bin/sh
set -e
cat << EOF
set superusers="root"
password_pbkdf2 root grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.B4E88xxxyourhashxxx
EOF
```

chmod a+x /etc/grub.d/01_passwd

Amend /etc/grub.d/10_linux, all the menu entries to add --unrestricted as below: (example line)

echo "menuentry '$(echo "$title" | grub_quote)' `--unrestricted` ${CLASS}

This is needed so as to be able to boot at the entries without the need to manually input the password. 

Update the grub configuration: 
update-grub2
reboot and verify

In this way you get protection for the menu entries, as the user must authenticate to be able to edit the boot menu.
